# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Using machine learning and neural networks predictions are made to help Alphabet Soup determine where to make investments. A binary classifier is created that can predict if an applicant will be successful if funding is provided.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- The target variable for the model is whether the money is used effectively, this is represented by the IS_SUCCESSFUL variable.

- APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT are variables that are considered to be the features for this model.

- EIN and NAME are neither targets nor feature variables and are removed from the input data.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
